# LAB 2 - Nim

## Description

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object.

## Lab Request

The lab request is to build and evolutionary strategy to play the Nim game.

## Collaborations

I took inspiration from the solution implemented by [Davide Vitabile](https://github.com/Vitabile/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main/lab2) for the development of the Evolutionary Agent. The kind of strategy I implemented is a $(1,\lambda)-ES$
